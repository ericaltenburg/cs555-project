This project served as practice for integrating some of the Extreme Programming (XP) and Scrum methods on a small team project. This is a simple command-line program, analogous to lint and PyLint, to discover errors and anomalies in GEDCOM genealogy files. 

This was project was implemented with Python and spanned across 15 weeks totalling 4 coding sprints consisting of 8 user stories (2 per developer) over an average of 2 weeks. Additionally, with the `.env` file there is a database functionality with MongoDB to store all the entires of the families and individuals.
